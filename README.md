# Worldr desktop plugins

Require plugins from the Go code as github.com/worldr/%plugin folder% vX.Y.Z, where X.Y.Z is a version from a tag called %plugin folder%/vX.Y.Z.

For example: app-badge plugin gets an update, tag the commit as "app-badge/vX.Y.Z", then require it from the desktop project as "github.com/worldr/app-badge vX.Y.Z".
